# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. The system supports early diagnosis and disease management.

-------

## Features
- Detects and classifies multiple plant diseases
- Identifies healthy vs. diseased leaves
- Uses CNN

--------

## Model Pipeline
1. Data Collection 
2. Preprocessing - Image resizing, normalization, augmentation
3. Modeling - CNN-based architecture
4. Training - Using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
5. Evaluation

--------

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Google Colab
